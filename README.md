Reddit-Scrolling <br>
This project deals with scrolling webpage to generate source code. <br>
Trick here is when the scrolling ends and we try to extract html code of page we will not get the comple page code. <br>
To overcome this we extract the code with each scroll and check if the details extracted don't get extracted twice. <br>
<br>
Note: if code don't work please check the proxies
